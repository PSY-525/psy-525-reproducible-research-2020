# Purpose

This document describes how to use Penn State's Jupyter notebook server system.

# Prerequisites

1. You must have a PSU Access ID (e.g., rog1).
2. You must have two-factor authentication set-up.
2. You must be connected to a secure, PSU-controlled network:

- `psu` wifi on campus
- hard-wired network connection on campus (e.g., from research lab or computer lab)
- Logged on to PSU's virtual private network (VPN)

# Accessing the Jupyter notebook server

1. Visit [`https://lxclusterapps.tlt.psu.edu:8000`](https://lxclusterapps.tlt.psu.edu:8000)

You should see the following login screen:

```{r, fig.cap="Jupyter notebook server login screen"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jupyter-psu-pre-login.jpg")
```

2. Enter your PSU logon credentials
3. Verify your identity using whatever two-factor authentication method you have chosen.

You should then see the following screen:

```{r, fig.cap="Jupyter notebook post-login"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/jupyter-psu-post-login.jpg")
```
