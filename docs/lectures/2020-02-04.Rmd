# Registration

## Registered reports

- What are they?
- Why are they a thing?
- Who's doing them?
- How they work and how to get involved

## What are they?

- Peer review and provisional acceptance of methodologically sound study proposals

## Why registered reports?

- Results (positive or null) don't determine publication (prevent publication bias)
- Reduce questionable practices
    + p-hacking
    + HARKing
    
## Why [**not**](http://www.cogsci.nl/blog/miscellaneous/215-the-pros-and-cons-of-pre-registration-in-fundamental-research) registered reports

- Restrict creativity in reporting "un-registered"/exploratory analyses?
    + Clearer communication about confirmatory vs. exploratory
- Mandatory vs. optional
- Clinical trials vs. fundamental research
- Exploration is not a dirty word

## Who's doing them?

- [Journals with Registered Reports](https://cos.io/rr/#journals) from COS
- How do they work?
    - Google sheet comparing features <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D4_k-8C_UENTRtbPzXfhjEyu3BfLxdOsn9j-otrO870/edit#gid=0>

## [AsPredicted.org](https://aspredicted.org/)

- Standardized preregistration tool
- Separate confirmatory from exploratory analyses
- One author completes checklist, others receive email to approve
- Unique (private) URL to pdf
- Share when you like or never

## Your thoughts on registered reports, pregistration?

# Tools for reproducible workflows

## [RStudio](http://rstudio.com)

- An integrated development environment (IDE) for R

## Components of RStudio

- Code editor
- R console
- Integrated help
- Image viewer
- Integration with git and other version-control packages
- Project management

## R Markdown

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
    - Mark-up language to make it easy to write HTML
- R Markdown a special type of Markdown
    - Allows for "literate" programming, mixing text, analysis, figures
    - Adds to Markdown syntax
    
## Let's do this...

- Open up RStudio
- Create a new R Markdown document
    - `File/New File/R Markdown...`

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-new-file.jpg")
```

---

- Select `Document`, call it something sensible like `psy-525-rmarkdown-testbed`
    - **NB**: This is the document's *title* not the name of the file.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio-new-rmarkdown.jpg")
```

---

- Save the file as `testbed.Rmd`

## Anatomy of an R Markdown file

- Header
- Chunks
- Text, etc.

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rmarkdown-testbed.jpg")
```


## [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) syntax

- Text formatting
    + *italics* by surrounding text with single asterisks or underscores: `*italics*` or `_italics_`
    + **boldface** by surrounding text with double asterisks or underscores: `**boldface**` or `__boldface__`
    
---

- Text formatting
    + ~~strikethrough~~ by surrounding text with double tildes: `~~strikethrough~~`
    + [Clickable URLs](http://www.psu.edu) by surrounding link text with square brackets and URL with parentheses: ```[Clickable URLs](http://www.psu.edu)```

## Markdown syntax

- Paragraph formatting
    + Headings with level specified by the number of hash (#) marks
    + Lists (bullet and enumerated)
    + Block quotes
    + Code blocks
    
----

```
# This is a Heading 1
## This is a Heading 2
### This is a Heading 3
```

----

Code:
```markdown
- An item
    - A nested item
        - A doubly-nested item
- Another item
```

- An item
    - A nested item
        - A doubly-nested item
- Another item


----

Code:
```markdown
1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item
```

1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item

*Notice how the numbers are incremented automatically!*

## Learn from my mistakes...

- `<CTRL>+2` goes to console
- `<CTRL>+1` goes to source
- `<UP-ARROW>` `<RETURN>`
- `<COMMAND><ALT>+I` (Mac OS) inserts a chunk
- Train your fingers now!

----

Code:
```markdown
> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President 
> spoke infamous words that would live on throughout history.
> These words are famous enough that I want to highlight them with a block quote.
```

> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President spoke infamous words that would live on throughout history.
> These words are famous enough that I want to highlight them with a block quote.


## More on Markdown syntax

- Images can be inserted using this syntax `![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)`
- Comments -- won't print in rendered output -- `<!- This is a comment ->`

## R Markdown additions

- `.Rmd` extension
- Combine text, code, images, figures, video
- "Computable" reports, documents, slide shows, notebooks
- Code in "chunks"
- Output in multiple formats from the same file

## Make some data

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)   # N(0,1)
y = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.5) # N(2, 0.5)
```
````

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)   # N(0,1)
y = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.5) # N(2, 0.5)
```

## Summary of x, y

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
summary(x)
summary(y)
```
````

```{r}
summary(x)
summary(y)
```

## Histogram of x

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
hist(x)
```
````

---

```{r}
hist(x)
```

## Histogram of y

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
hist(y)
```
````

---

```{r}
hist(y)
```

## X vs. Y

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
plot(x,y)
```
````

---

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

## Embed figure using "chunk" syntax

````markdown
`r ''````{r rog, fig.cap="Rick's pic from Databrary"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nyu.databrary.org/party/6/avatar")
```
````

---

```{r rog, fig.cap="Rick's pic from Databrary"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nyu.databrary.org/party/6/avatar")
```

## Embed figure using HTML

`<img src="img/sleic.jpg" height=500px>`

Height parameter (or, e.g. `height=500px`) is optional, but useful. Remember Markdown -> HTML.

----

<img src="img/sleic.jpg" height=500px>

## Learn from my mistakes

- Don't change your working directory...*EVAH*!
- Give R Markdown document "local" paths.

## Embed YouTube video

HTML Code (**not** in a chunk--not talking to R)
```markdown
<iframe width="420" height="315" 
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hUy9ePyo6Q" 
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
```

- YouTube gives you code to cut and paste to 'embed' a video.
- Just copy and paste

----

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9hUy9ePyo6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Printing computed variables

Code (in a chunk):
````markdown
`r ''````{r}
summ.x = summary(x)
summ.y = summary(y)
names(summ.x) # Figure out variable names for indexing
```
````

```{r}
summ.x = summary(x)
summ.y = summary(y)
names(summ.x) # Figure out variable names for indexing
```

----

*Index by variable name:* X lies within the range of [`r summ.x["Min."]`, `r summ.x["Max."]`].

*Index by numeric index:* The (y-x) difference in means is `r summ.y[4] - summ.x[4]`.

*Calculate and report:* The correlation between x and y is `r cor(x,y)`.

## All in your head(er)

- R Markdown documents have header text written in YAML
- [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) = YAML Ain't Markup Language

----

`---`</br>
`title: "One Code to Rule Them All"`</br>
`author: "Rick O. Gilmore"`</br>
`date: "July 4, 1776"`</br>
`output: html_document`</br>
`---`</br></br>

## Default output is `html_document`

- `rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd")` creates a single HTML file
- The `output: html_document` line specifies the default format for the file
- Omitting the `output:` or `author:` or `date:` commands still yields an HTML file

## Getting fancier

- `rmarkdown::render()` can take an `output_format` parameter
- `rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "html_document")` renders an HTML file as before

---

- `rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "word_document")` renders an MS Word document
- `rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")` renders a PDF document

----

`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "html_document")`</br>
`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "word_document")`</br>
`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")`

---

Or, just

`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = c("html_document", "word_document", "pdf_document"))`

makes all three with **one** command.

## Y'all can customize your YAML

- Default `html_document` output creates a single HTML file with all figures embedded via
    + `self_contained: true`
- Nice for sharing a single file with collaborators
- Not so if you want to save the figures for other uses
- If `self_contained: false`, then figures are written to separate directory

----

`---`</br>
`title: "One Code to Rule Them All"`</br>
`author: "Rick O. Gilmore"`</br>
`date: "July 4, 1776"`</br>
`output:`</br>
  `html_document:`</br>
    `self_contained: false`</br>
`---`</br></br>

## Exploring report parameters

## Presentations

- **HTML (ioslides)**
- HTML (Slidy)
- PDF (Beamer)

## ioslides basics

- New slides with titles start with double-hashes  

`## New Slide Title`

- New slides without titles start with four dashes 

`----`

## ioslides basics

- Bullet points start with single dashes 

`- Bulleted item 1`</br>
`- Bulleted item 2`

- if `incremental: FALSE` in YAML header (the default), then 

`>- Incremental bullet` 

allows you to show one bullet at a time for that slide

## ioslides basics

- Embedding figures requires some HTML 

`<img src="fig.jpg">` embeds 

- Embedding videos depends on source
    + YouTube provides code
    + Embedding other (even local) videos requires HTML

## ioslides formatting

```
<div class="centered">
...
</div>
```

Centers items between the `<div>` and `<\div>` tags vertically.

## ioslides formatting

```
---
The three dashes will start a new slide without a header.
## Slide with a header
- Some text
---
Another header-less slide
```

## Rendering ioslides

`---`</br>
`title: "One Code to Rule Them All"`</br>
`author: "Rick O. Gilmore"`</br>
`date: "July 4, 1776"`</br>
**`output: ioslides_presentation`**</br>
`---`</br>

in your file header, or

`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "ioslides_presentation")`

on the fly.

## Parameters for ioslides

`incremental: false`</br>

Turns off incremental reveal of bullets.

`widescreen: true`</br>

Makes slides work well with 16:9 aspect ratio screens.

## Documents

- HTML documents, `output_format="html_document"`
- **MS Word documents,`output_format="word_document"`**
- PDF documents, `output_format="pdf_document"`

## MS Word document basics

See <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/word_document_format.html>

```
---
...
output:
  word_document:
    fig_width: 5
    fig_height: 5
    fig_caption: false
    df_print: kable
...
---
```    

## Rendering MS Word documents

`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "word_document")`

if your document header *does not* have parameters for word_document, or

`rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd")`

if your document header has the parameters and `word_document` is first in the list.

## PDF documents

See <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/pdf_document_format.html>

- Put in 1st position in header, then `rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd")` 
- Or, `rmarkdown::render(input = "my-report.Rmd", output_format = "pdf_document")`
- Must [install LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) for this to work

---

```
---
...
  pdf_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
...
---
```

## Some useful parameters for the `rmarkdown::render()` command

- `output_file = myslides.ioslides.html` or `output_file = myslides.slidy.html` to specify different output file targets.
- `output_dir = reports` or `output_dir = docx` to direct output to a specific directory.
- `params = list(name = "Joe", quest = "Find the grail", favorite.color = "blue")` to pass parameters that R can use via `params$name`
