# Lists

## Not enumerated

- An item
    - A nested item with **boldface**
        - A doubly-nested item with *italics*
- Another item with some ~~text stricken out~~

## Enumerated

1. An enumerated item
    - A nested item
1. A second enumerated item
    a. A nested item with a footnote [^1] marker. Look for the text at the end of the document.
    a. A second nested item. See how alphabetical enumerated lists work like you'd expect.
    
[^1]: Here is the footnote text. Note that it ends up at the end of the document.

## Block quotation

> Four score and seven years ago, some famous President spoke infamous words that would live on throughout history.
> These words are famous enough that I want to highlight them with a block quote.

# Make some data

```{r}
x = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)   # N(0,1)
y = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 2, sd = 0.5) # N(2, 0.5)
```

## Summarize

```{r}
summary(x)
summary(y)
```

## Histogram

```{r}
hist(x)
```

## Plot

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

# Embed figures or videos

## From the web

```{r rog, fig.cap="Rick's pic from Databrary"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://nyu.databrary.org/party/6/avatar")
```

# Printing values from R

```{r}
summ.x = summary(x)
summ.y = summary(y)
names(summ.x) # Figure out variable names for indexing
```

*Index by variable name:* X lies within the range of [`r summ.x["Min."]`, `r summ.x["Max."]`].

*Index by numeric index:* The (y-x) difference in means is `r summ.y[4] - summ.x[4]`.

*Calculate and report:* The correlation between x and y is `r cor(x,y)`.
