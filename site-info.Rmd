This site is generated in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using [RStudio](http://rstudio.com).

```{r, child="_sessioninfo.Rmd"}
```

I make extensive use of the documentation in <https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html> and enjoy trying out different themes based on <https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/>.
